## Posting 

_Review it this makes sense._

In case of a post without images or other assets, simply create a new post.

```
hugo new content content/posts/my-first-post.md
```

In case of a post with images or other assets use a leaf bundle.

> A leaf bundle is a directory that contains an index.md file and zero or more resources. Analogous to a physical leaf, a leaf bundle is at the end of a branch. It has no descendants.

See the Just Testing post for an example.
